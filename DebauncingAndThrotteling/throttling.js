// THROTTLING :
    // Similar to debauncing but with a time window i.e a function cannot be executed
    // untill a certain time has passed after an event. in debauncing the fucntion is executed only after the 
    // user stops the executing the repetitive event and after which the delay happens and the function is executed.
    // while in throttling the function is executed after the event and only once in an set Interval.
