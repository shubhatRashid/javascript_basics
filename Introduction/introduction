WHY DO WE NEED A LANGUAGE ?
    Before starting an application , it resides in SSD (solid state drive) of the machine.
    When we start an application the compiler converts the code of the application into 0s and 1s
    This code is fed to RAM which understands this code and runs the application.

    Directly writing code in 0s and 1s is quite difficult hence languages like js,python,c++ are used.

INTERPRETED VS COMPILED LANGUAGES :
    Languages which take the code file and form a compiled file of it before running it are compiled
    languages e.g c,c++ These languages do not run any code if there is an error in the code and hence 
    are safer to use.

    Langueges which compile code line by line are interpreted languages e.g python, js etc.
    If there is an error in the code . The code above the error line will still work.

STATIC VS DYNAMIC LANGUAGEES :
    Static languages set the type of a variable at the time of decleration and this type cannot 
    be changed afterwards e.g c++ hence These languages are efficient as they are less prone to 
    errors.

    Dynamic languages can changes type of a variable anytime e.g python , js . These languages are
    prone to errors and hence typescript was developed to overcome such and many more limitations of js.

Note : 
    Javascript is a single threaded language i.e it uses one core at a time.
